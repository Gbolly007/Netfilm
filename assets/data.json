    "reviewComment": "Martin Scorsese's The Irishman is a magisterial mob epic...this movie is reflective,more about greatness and loss..Scorsese has brought back the lost charm of gangster movies with this masterpiece after so many years..but don't expect that this movie is executed with the same manner of Goodfellas.",
